# My Cheat Sheets

These cheat sheets are a collection of notes and references that I find useful but not essential for my programming work. While I can program without them, they come in handy in specific situations:

- **Rarely Used Topics**: When I need to work with something I haven't touched in years.
- **Forgotten Details**: To quickly find a specific command or code snippet that I've forgotten.

## **Contents**
- [Git Cheat Sheet](git/git-cheat-sheet.md)

## **Purpose**
This repository is designed to:
- **Serve as a Backup Memory**: A place to store information that I might need later.
- **Save Time**: Quickly find solutions instead of searching online.
- **Stay Organized**: Keep everything in one place for easy access.
